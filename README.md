## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with completing the given code to give the user a prompt using the command line interface (CLI) to walk through setting up their own team.

```
This can be started by using the terminal to type the command "node app.js" with node installed to start the code and enter the CLI. The user may need to type the command "npm install" to install required packages if the program doesn't work out of the box.
```

The user is required to enter the information for their manager to start. Next, the user is given the choice to add an Engineer, an Intern, or finish and render the html page. If the user selects one of the team members, they are given additional prompts to enter that team members information. The user can add as many team members as they would like. When the user is finished, they can select the option to finish and render. Then, an html page is rendered containing cards filled in with the information of team members they have created.
